    " It’s a technology that came into existence after the 2008 crisis. That time the world felt that we require a peer to peer transaction technology. The blocks save the data in them, and for each data, a hash is created. And that hash is linked to the very next block. If we tried to change the data in 1st block the hash will be changed and it won’t be the same as the next block. It provides security to the data.\n"
